This project implement a perceptron training algorithm using threshold unit.
Perceptron is a basic foundation of the neural network and related machine learning algorihtm.
In this project, it shows how the perceptron works and how powerful it is!

First, this project solved a very famous problem XOR, which caused the the nueral network paradigms fallen into dark age in 1969.
